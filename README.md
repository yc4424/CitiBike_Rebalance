# CitiBike_Rebalance
This project involves analyzing Citi Bike data to reconstruct a visual encoding of station activity and balance from 2013, enhancing understanding of operational strategies.

The graph created in this project visualizes hourly activity and balance at Citi Bike stations, depicting the flow of bikes and highlighting imbalances between incoming and outgoing bikes at different times of the day. This helps identify peak usage periods and stations needing rebalancing efforts.
